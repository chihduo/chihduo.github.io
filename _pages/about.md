I'm an Assistant Professor with the Department of Management Information Systems at National Chengchi University (NCCU) in Taiwan. Before my journey at NCCU, I had the opportunity to work as a postdoctoral researcher at Rheinland-Pf√§lzische Technische Universit√§t Kaiserslautern-Landau (RPTU) in Germany and as a visiting scholar at Uppsala University, Sweden. I earned my DPhil/PhD from the University of Oxford and completed my MSc and BSc at National Taiwan University.

Research Interests ü§ì
-----
My work involves employing mathematical and logical methods to gain insights into how systems and software behave. Below are the main areas I focus on:

- Verification and testing of software and AI systems
- Model checking and automated generation of proofs and programs
- Automated reasoning about modal and temporal logic

I would love to supervise students interested in studying these topics. If you have an exciting project in mind, don‚Äôt hesitate to email me so we can chat more about it!

__To new graduate students:__ Welcome aboard! Our lab's research theme for 2025-2027 is the synergy between AI (e.g., neural networks and large language models) and automated software engineering (e.g., program analysis, verification, and testing). Feel free to contact me if you're interested in exploring this fascinating research area in your master's program.

Below is some advice I feel very helpful to junior researchers (like me), postdocs, and PhD students.

### Core Principles ‚ú®

* *Value your time.* Protect it wisely.
* *Master the power of writing.* This includes natural languages, programming languages, and mathematical proofs.
* *Strive for clarity of thought.*
* Above all, *be kind*.

### For PhD Students üéì

A PhD is an intense yet rewarding personal journey. You are not alone; here is some advice from fellow PhD students and graduates who have walked this path:
