I'm an Assistant Professor with the Department of Management Information Systems at National Chengchi University (NCCU) in Taiwan. Before my journey at NCCU, I had the opportunity to work as a postdoctoral researcher at Rheinland-Pfälzische Technische Universität Kaiserslautern-Landau (RPTU) in Germany. I earned my DPhil/PhD from the University of Oxford and completed my MSc and BSc at National Taiwan University.

Research Interests
-----
I'm passionate about making software systems safe for everyone! My work involves employing formal and mathematical methods to gain insights and verify how systems behave, especially those made up of numerous similar components. I love using techniques from formal verification and logic to explore this fascinating field. Below, I've outlined the main areas I focus on:

- Verification and testing of software and AI systems
- Model checking and automated generation of proofs and programs
- Automated reasoning about modal and temporal logic

I would love to supervise PhD, MSc, or BSc students interested in studying these topics. If you have an exciting project in mind, don’t hesitate to email me so we can chat more about it!
